# 2. This allows us to exit the script early by using exit
# 1 if we receive no command line arguments from the user. We then begin a
# second if condition that uses the file test operator to check whether the
# input is a file.

# 3. Below this condition, we use elif to test whether the
# argument is a directory.

# 4. This condition won’t be tested unless the file
# test fails. If neither of these conditions is true, the script responds that the
# argument is neither a file nor a directory
else
echo "${USER_INPUT} is not a file or a directory."
